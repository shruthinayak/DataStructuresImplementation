Ver 1.0: Initial description (Feb 4, 8:00 AM).
Ver 1.1: Zip file with simpler index (Feb 11, 8:00 AM).

	(Ver 1.0: was http://www.utdallas.edu/~rbk/teach/2016s/java/pq.zip)

1. Implement BinaryHeap
2. Implement IndexedHeap and Prim's MST algorithm (MST.java)
3. Compare the running times of Prim1 (priority queue of edges)
   and Prim2 (indexed priority queue of vertices).
